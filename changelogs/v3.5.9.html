    Make client key bindings for e.g. xeyes work again
    
    Instead of focusing the root window, we now create a "focus window" inside of
    our frame window. This window is placed so that it is not visible, but we can
    grab key bindings on it to simulate the window having the input focus.

    Fix arguments to luaL_checkstack()
    
    The argument to luaL_checkstack() is the amount of new stack to make available,
    not the new size of the stack. Thus, remove the addition of lua_gettop(L) here.

    Balance the stack in luaA_loadrc()
    
    In various conditions, luaA_loadrc() left luaA_dofunction_on_error and an error
    message on the Lua stack. Also, it used LUA_MULTRET without looking at the
    return values. Fix all of this and reorder the code a bit to make it easier to
    follow.

    Fix unbalance Lua stack usage in event_handle_leavenotify()
    
    Commit 42e00819584c removed a call to lua_pop(L,1) that was still necessary.
    This commit adds that call again.

    Check that the Lua stack is empty in the main loop
    
    The Lua stack is a finite resource and everything that pushes something there
    should also clean up. This is not a problem for functions that are called by
    Lua, because their "stack frame" is freed when they return. However, in global
    context, Lua does not and cannot automatically clean up for us. Thus, it makes
    sense to print a warning in this case.
    
    (Additionally, this cleans up the stack if something is left)

    Fix awful.ewmh to handle window gravities
    
    Since commit b2aaefd095c964491f2c93a, we correctly handle window gravities when
    the border width of a client changes. Since most windows out there have a
    NorthWest gravity, this means that most windows do not have this problem.
    However, e.g. mplayer uses gravity "Static" and this causes this issue (any
    gravity other than NorthWest will do).
    
    This affects the fullscreen handling in awful.ewmh. The code has to set the
    border width before it changes a client's geometry so that the move when the
    border width changes doesn't matter.
    
    No new integration test for this since I didn't find anything usable with a
    non-NorthWest gravity. A test would be easy to write, just test if `c.fullscreen
    = true ; c.fullscreen = false` restores the previous window geometry.

    Don't modify WM_HINTS in client_set_urgent()
    
    To quote from ICCCM (ยง4.1.2): "The window manager will not change properties
    written by the client."
    
    We tried to do this anyway to update WM_HINTS so that the current urgency state
    is reflected. Apparently, Chrome does a similar read-modify-set cycle and the
    resulting race condition meant that the "accepts input" hint on Chromium's
    window was permanently disabled.
    
    This helps with https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/670, but I still
    think that Chrome shouldn't try to implement "please don't focus me when I do
    the following" by temporarily claiming "please don't ever focus me".

    Always send ConfigureNotifies
    
    ICCCM specifies when the WM has to send a ConfigureNotify. Java does not care
    and wants one all the time. Meh.
