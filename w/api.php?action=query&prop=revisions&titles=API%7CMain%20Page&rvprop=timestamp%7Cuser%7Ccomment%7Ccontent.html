== Lua extensions ==
[[Image:Lua.jpg|left|Lua extensions]]
&amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;margin-left: 70px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
Lua is a fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. 

Common uses of Lua are:
* A configuration language for applications.
* A standalone scripting language.
* An embedded language in applications to modify runtime behaviour.

To get introduced into Lua, please read [[The_briefest_introduction_to_Lua | the briefest introduction to Lua]]. For deeper knowledge please read this [<a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaTutorial">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaTutorial</a> tutorial] for the newcomers to the language. As a suggestion, please consider to get this [<a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaShortReference">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaShortReference</a> Lua Short Reference].
